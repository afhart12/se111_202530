        <p style="border: 1px solid burlywood">Hello, my name is Alex Hart. I am in my <i>third term</i> here at NEIT, and I am really enjoying it! At the end of this term, I will graduate high school, exit the Early College Program, and proceed to Term 4 as a regular student. Additionally, I have a cat named <b>Twilight</b>, and she is the <u>cutest cat in the world</u>! She is a one-year-old tuxedo cat, and enjoys things like hiding in bags and playing with elastics.</p>
