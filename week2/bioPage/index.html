        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Alex Hart. I am in my first year of college at New England Institute of Technology. My major is software engineering. This path is the most intriguing to me because I have always taken a liking to computers and their background processes. Additionally, I enjoy spending time with my family and my cat. I have also taught myself to play the piano and the guitar. Thanks for visiting my Bio Website!</p>
