                <p>This show was absolutely amazing! Each character is so wonderfully developed and complex. I also loved the wide range of representation and diversity in the characters. Luz has an amazing journey of self-discovery, and everyone can learn something from it. Being true to yourself has great importance!!</p>

                
                <p>Dana Terrace really made a wonderful show with the time she had at Disney. I wish that Disney didn't cut the third season short. If the show had a third season, it could've aired some more fun filler episodes instead of strictly plot-related content. However, I still loved the show and would love it either way.</p>
