                <p>This show was absolutely amazing! Each character is so wonderfully developed and complex. I also loved the wide range of representation and diversity in the characters. Luz has an amazing journey of self-discovery, and everyone can learn something from it. Being true to yourself has great importance!!</p>

                
                <p>Dana Terrace really made a wonderful show with the time she had at Disney. I wish that Disney didn't cut the third season short. If the show had a third season, it could've aired some more fun filler episodes instead of strictly plot-related content. However, I still loved the show and would love it either way.</p>

                    <h3><em>The Owl House</em> Trivia!!</h3>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Disney cut the third season of the show to three 40-minute episodes. They claimed it was due to the fact that the show "didn't fit the brand."</li>
                        <li>The first letter of each episode spells out a secret message for each season! The first seasons secret message is "A Witch Loses a True Way." The second seasons message is "Seek the Key, Fear the Lock." Although the third season only had three episodes, the first words of each title spelled out "Thanks for Watching."</li>
                        <li>Alex Hirsch came up with the concept of Hooty's voice after doing his best Mickey Mouse impression. It ended up being Hooty's voice, and it stuck for three years!</li>
                        <li>The Owl House was the first Disney TV show to feature a queer relationship between two main characters! Luz and Amity clearly confirm their relationship in Season 2 and continue it through the end of the series.</li>
                        <li>Dana Terrace's main inspiration to keep writing her "weird" show came from a collegue who kept telling her that no one will like her concept. Just a reminder to follow your dreams and believe in your work!</li>
